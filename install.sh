#!/bin/sh
# claude-session-handoff installer.
# Installs the handoff hooks, slash command, skill, and (if needed)
# the shared claude-wrapper.sh that both claude-restart and
# claude-session-handoff coordinate through.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh              Install
#   ./install.sh --uninstall  Remove all claude-session-handoff changes
#
# Env vars (for sandbox testing):
#   CLAUDE_DIR          Override ~/.claude
#   RC_FILE_OVERRIDE    Force a specific shell rc file
#   SHELL_NAME_OVERRIDE Force shell detection (zsh|bash|fish)
#
# Shared wrapper protocol — see scripts/claude-wrapper.sh.
# Both installers:
#   1. Compare their bundled wrapper version against the installed one and
#      overwrite only if their version is higher (idempotent, latest-wins).
#   2. Maintain a single shell-function block in the user's rc file,
#      marked by `# claude-wrapper: start/end`, with a `# registered-by:`
#      line listing every tool that needs the wrapper. Install adds the
#      tool's name; uninstall removes it (and the entire block when empty).
#   3. Migrate legacy per-tool blocks (`# claude-restart: start`,
#      `# claude-session-handoff: start`) into the shared block.
#
# Supports: zsh, bash, fish.

# --- Atomic file installation ---

# Install SRC at DST by writing a sibling temp file and renaming it into place.
# Args: $1 = source, $2 = destination, $3 = optional chmod mode.
#
# `cp` onto DST truncates and rewrites DST's EXISTING inode. A POSIX shell reads
# a script incrementally, and claude-wrapper.sh blocks inside `run_claude "$@"`
# for the whole session with its dispatch loop still unread — so overwriting it
# in place makes that shell resume at a byte offset that now points into
# different content, in the process that owns the user's terminal. Renaming
# swaps the directory entry to a NEW inode instead; the running shell keeps its
# open file description on the old one and finishes cleanly.
#
# The temp file must be a sibling of DST: `mv` is atomic only within a
# filesystem, and across one it degrades to copy-and-unlink.
# Covered by tests/wrapper-atomic-install.sh.
